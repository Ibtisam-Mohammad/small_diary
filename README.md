- Created my small mining rig with RTX 3060 (early 2020) for trial ---> then Merge happened ---> Using for light ML tasks and testing new models locally
- I find croc to be better than magic wormhole in a task where large file transfer is required. wormhole speeds just hit rock bottom before the half way mark

- Setup Ollama server, ran small 7B models, were slow, but hopefully would catch up
- Tested out Automated-AI-Web-Researcher-Ollama (`https://github.com/TheBlewish/Automated-AI-Web-Researcher-Ollama`), last year, thought of finding the potential drug candidates out there for a project using it. Deep Research agents were not as powerful back then.
- Ran Microsoft Fara-7B
