> A collection of small tidbits, learnings, and experiments.

- **Mining Rig**: Created my small mining rig with RTX 3060 (early 2020) for trial. After the Merge, I started using it for light ML tasks and testing new models locally.
- **File Transfer**: I find [croc](https://github.com/schollz/croc) to be better than magic wormhole in a task where large file transfer is required. Wormhole speeds just hit rock bottom before the half way mark.
- **Ollama**: Setup Ollama server, ran small 7B models, were slow, but hopefully would catch up.
- **AI Researcher**: Tested out [Automated-AI-Web-Researcher-Ollama](https://github.com/TheBlewish/Automated-AI-Web-Researcher-Ollama) last year. Thought of finding the potential drug candidates out there for a project using it. Deep Research agents were not as powerful back then.
- **[Fara-7B](./fara-7b)**: Ran Microsoft Fara-7B.
